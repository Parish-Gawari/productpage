# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Create One Home where you have to show the products in card format . https://dummyjson.com/products use this api for get products data. when i click on particular products ,it should be open on new page with details.
Add one button on this page which is BUY button. when you click on the button it should be check the user is logged in or not . if user is not logged in then it should be redirect to signIn page . If user is login then after click on BUY button show alert as "Ordered Successfully".

Note : use Context API to store the data.
